# Predator-Sense
PredatorSense is a monitoring and protection system that harnesses the power of machine learning and deep learning. It employs SSD MobileNet for efficient and accurate object detection in natural habitats
# System Performance
In [1], the AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 models achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 84.7% on the Snapshot Serengeti and NACTI datasets. Another study [2] using a self-collected dataset and a CCN model reported a slightly lower mAP of 77%. In comparison, our proposed system, which integrates SSD MobileNet with OpenCV and is trained on the Google Open Images dataset, achieved a competitive mAP of 85.53%.

The system integrates Twilio's API to send SMS notifications. Upon detecting wildlife, an automated process triggers an alert message to a designated phone number, ensuring timely user notification
